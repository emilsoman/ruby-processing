  Ruby-Processing is a Ruby wrapper for the Processing code art framework. It's
  this thin little shim that squeezes between Processing and JRuby, passing
  along some neat goodies like:

  * Application exporting of your sketches. Hand them out to your party guests, 
    ready-to-run.

  * Live Coding via JRuby's IRB. Loads in your sketch so you can futz with
    variables and remake methods on the fly.

  * Bare sketches. Write your Ruby-Processing sketches without having to define
    a class. Without defining methods, even.

  * A "Control Panel" library, so that you can easily create sliders, buttons,
    checkboxes and drop-down menus, and hook them into your sketch's instance
    variables.

  * "Watch" mode, where Ruby-Processing keeps an eye on your sketch and reloads
    it from scratch every time you make a change. A pretty nice REPL-ish way
    to work on your Processing sketches.
